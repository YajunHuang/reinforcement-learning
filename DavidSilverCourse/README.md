# David Silver's RL course

## Description
I do this work for writing notes and doing exercises of David Silver's open course,
But the learning materials I used are not limited to course slides and videos.
[dennybritz/reinforcement-learning](https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning) is the main reference of this work.
